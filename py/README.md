# Python tools



* circulant.py computes the determinant of circulant matrix

* gram_rMdN.py computes the determinant of Gram matrix for the monomial basis

N - dimension of the vector space

M - rank of the momonials

* gram_eMd4.py computes the determinant of Gram matrix for the Kronecker's basis

M = 2 * (number of Kronecker's deltas)

Warning: gram_e8d4.py is very slow.
